# RAG Chatbot using Pinecone and Gradio

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a small-scale Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that integrates [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) for vector database management and [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for an interactive user interface. The chatbot combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

## Key Components

- **Pinecone Integration:** Pinecone is used to store and manage embeddings, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant documents or knowledge snippets based on the user's query.

- **Generative Model:** A pre-trained language model (such as GPT-3 or a similar model) is utilized to generate responses based on the retrieved content, ensuring that the chatbot delivers coherent and contextually appropriate answers.

- **Gradio Interface:** Gradio provides a simple, user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot. Users can input queries and receive real-time responses, with features to visualize the retrieval process and display confidence scores.

## Objectives

- Build a functional RAG chatbot capable of handling queries within a specific domain.
- Implement an efficient retrieval system using Pinecone to enhance response relevance and accuracy.
- Design an intuitive interface with Gradio to facilitate seamless user interactions with the chatbot.

## Expected Outcomes

- A working prototype of a RAG chatbot that can handle domain-specific questions.
- A practical understanding of integrating vector databases with generative models.
- Experience in building interactive AI applications using Gradio.
